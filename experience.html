                As a member of our child welfare club, I was actively involved in promoting children's rights and well-being. We organized workshops and campaigns to educate our community about child rights and address issues affecting children. We conducted a donation program on Children's Day to support hospitalized children and disabled children in our community.
                In addition, we organized a week-long self-defense training program to empower children with essential skills to protect themselves. Our achievements include preventing eight child marriages and rescuing three children from abuse, providing them with safe housing and support. These successes motivate us to keep working to protect children and create a safer environment for them in our community.
